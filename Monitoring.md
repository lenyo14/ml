# Model Monitoring & Retraining

## Logging & Monitoring

### Storing Predictions
To ensure transparency and facilitate debugging, predictions generated by the model should be stored in a scalable and queryable database. Recommended storage solutions include:
- **Elasticsearch (ELK Stack):** Enables powerful searching and filtering capabilities, ideal for analyzing model outputs over time.
- **Loki:** A cost-effective, high-performance log aggregation tool that efficiently stores logs without indexing every field.

### System Logging and Monitoring Without External Tools
Monitoring system health and model performance without relying on external tools requires a structured approach that includes:

- **Custom Logging Framework:** Implement structured logging within the ML pipeline using Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module or similar approaches. Logs should include:
  - Request IDs and timestamps for traceability.
  - Input data summaries and transformations.
  - Model inference times and confidence scores.

- **Manual Log Storage and Querying:**
  - Store logs in CSV, JSON, or a lightweight database like SQLite for manual analysis.
  - Use Python scripts to query and aggregate logs periodically.

- **Performance Dashboard Development:**
  - Develop a lightweight visualization dashboard using **Matplotlib**, **Dash**, or **Streamlit** to track key metrics.
  - Display rolling averages of latency, prediction accuracy, and failure rates.

- **Threshold-Based Alerting:**
  - Implement manual threshold checks within Python scripts.
  - Use email notifications or simple messaging systems like Slack webhooks to alert on anomalies.

- **Batch Data Audits:**
  - Periodically run batch scripts to evaluate the distribution of input data versus model predictions.
  - Identify inconsistencies by comparing rolling statistics over time.

## Concept Drift Detection

### Tracking Model Performance Metrics
Continuous evaluation of model performance is crucial to identify concept drift, which occurs when the data distribution changes over time. Essential metrics to monitor include:
- **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):** Measures the classifier's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
- **Precision-Recall:** Essential for imbalanced datasets, tracking the proportion of relevant instances among retrieved ones.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** Helps assess how often the model incorrectly classifies negative instances as positive, which is critical in high-risk applications.

### Detection Strategies
- **Window-Based Performance Tracking:** Compare model performance across different time windows to detect gradual drift.
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Use techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify shifts in feature distributions.
- **Drift Detection Models:** Implement drift detection algorithms such as ADWIN or DDM to identify significant deviations in model performance.

By implementing robust logging, monitoring, and drift detection strategies, organizations can ensure model reliability and proactively initiate retraining workflows when needed.
